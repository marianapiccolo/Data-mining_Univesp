The database for this exercise is the "Number of students by type of education" of the São Paulo state network in 2021. The base has 25 attributes, among which are:

         "* **MUN**: city,
         "* **ZONA**: zone (1 = urban, 2 - rural),
         "* **ANOS INICIAIS**: Early years of elementary school,
         "* **ANOS FINAIS**: Final years of elementary school,
         "* **ENSINO MEDIO**: Early years of high school,
The data is being imported directly from the [Portal de Dados Abertos da Educação do Estado de São Paulo](https://dados.educacao.sp.gov.br/dataset/quantidade-de-alunos-por-tipo-de-ensino-da-rede-estadual).,

The data dictionary is available at this [link](https://dados.educacao.sp.gov.br/dicion%C3%A1rio-de-dados-de-quantidade-de-alunos-por-tipo-de-ensino).
